# Restaurant-functioning-using-multi-threading-and-synchronization

In this project I have used multi programming and synchronization primitives for the functioning of a restaurant.
Functioning of restaurant includes many tasks which has to be done in an order so as to satisfy the customer. Some of them are checking if the tables are available, assigning the tables to the customers in the order of arrival, availability of cooks, availability of items in the menu. 
Keeping in mind all these tasks, I have used the Advanced Operating Systems concepts to build this model.
